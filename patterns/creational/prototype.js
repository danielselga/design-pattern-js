/** PROTOTYPE PATTERN -> A partially  or fully initialized object that you copy (clone) and make use of.
 * Complicated objects (e.g car) aren't designed from scratch.
    * They reiterate existing deisgns.
 * An existing (partially of fully constructed) design is a Prototype.
 * We make a copy (clone) the prototype and customize it.
    * Require deep copy support
 * We make cloning convenient (e.g via a factory).
